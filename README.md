# @oidfed/* — OpenID Federation 1.0

The complete [OpenID Federation 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0.html) implementation for JavaScript — runtime-agnostic, spec-compliant, built on Web API standards. Trust chain resolution and validation, metadata policy enforcement, trust marks, constraint checking, and automatic and explicit client registration — split across four focused packages built on Web API primitives (`Request → Response`), running anywhere JavaScript runs: Node.js, Deno, Bun, and beyond. All persistent state is behind pluggable storage interfaces, keeping database and HSM integrations entirely outside the core packages. The only runtime dependencies are [`jose`](https://github.com/panva/jose) and [`zod`](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod). Two operational utilities — a CLI and a browser-based explorer — complete the toolchain.

For integration examples, see the [Wiring Guide](docs/guide/wiring-guide.md). For production storage backends (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis) and HSM key stores, see the [Storage Guide](docs/guide/storage-guide.md). To run a full multi-topology federation locally with wildcard DNS and TLS, see the [Dev Guide](docs/guide/dev.md) and [E2E Test infrastructure](docs/test/e2e.md).

The repository also ships a CLI ([`@oidfed/cli`](docs/tools/cli.md)), a live federation explorer at [explore.oidfed.com](https://explore.oidfed.com), an interactive course at [learn.oidfed.com](https://learn.oidfed.com), and a few internal packages that support the workspace — browse the source or the [docs/](docs/) directory to learn more.

## DID Method Support

`@oidfed/did` provides pluggable drivers for blockchain-anchored DID methods, enabling federation participants to resolve, validate, and extract signing keys from decentralized identifiers — without coupling federation logic to any blockchain.

```ts
import { createDefaultRegistry, DIDDriverRegistry } from "@oidfed/did";
import { HederaDIDDriver, HieroDIDDriver, PolygonDIDDriver } from "@oidfed/did";

// Registry with all built-in drivers
const registry = createDefaultRegistry({
  hedera: {},
  hiero: { network: "enterprise" },
  polygon: { rpcUrl: "https://polygon-rpc.com" },
});

// Resolve a DID document
const doc = await registry
  .getForDid("did:hedera:mainnet:0.0.12345")
  .resolve("did:hedera:mainnet:0.0.12345");

// Extract signing keys as JWK[] — ready for federation use
const keys = await registry
  .getForDid("did:polygon:polygon-mainnet:0xabc…")
  .getSigningKeys("did:polygon:polygon-mainnet:0xabc…");

// Validate a DID
const valid = await registry
  .getForDid("did:hiero:mainnet:enterprise:alice")
  .validate("did:hiero:mainnet:enterprise:alice");
```

### Plug a custom DID method

```ts
import { DIDDriverRegistry, type DIDMethodDriver, type DIDDocument } from "@oidfed/did";
import type { JWK } from "@oidfed/core";

class MyCustomDriver implements DIDMethodDriver {
  method(): string { return "my-method"; }
  async resolve(did: string): Promise<DIDDocument> { /* … */ }
  async validate(did: string): Promise<boolean> { /* … */ }
  async getSigningKeys(did: string): Promise<JWK[]> { /* … */ }
  supportsAnchoring(): boolean { return false; }
}

const registry = new DIDDriverRegistry([new MyCustomDriver()]);
```

### Drivers

| Driver | Method | Use Case |
|--------|--------|----------|
| `HederaDIDDriver` | `did:hedera` | Public Hedera Network — mirror node REST API resolution, HCS-based DIDs |
| `HieroDIDDriver` | `did:hiero` | LF Hyperledger Hiero permissioned ledgers — governance-aware metadata, sovereign/enterprise federation |
| `PolygonDIDDriver` | `did:polygon` | Polygon/EVM ecosystem — Universal Resolver + JSON-RPC fallback, EVM-compatible signatures |

## Related Specifications

[OpenID Federation 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0.html) has been factored into two final successor specifications (1.1 protocol-independent + 1.1 for OpenID Connect) that together cover exactly the same functionality as 1.0. Several active extensions build on top of 1.0/1.1 — wallets, large-federation discovery, ACME certificate issuance, and more. The table below tracks every Federation-family specification we are aware of, with this monorepo's implementation status alongside.

| Specification | Spec status | This monorepo | Scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| [**OpenID Federation 1.0**](https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0.html) | **Final** ✓ (2026-02-17) |  **Implemented** | Foundational protocol: Entity Statements, Trust Chains, Metadata, Policies, Trust Marks, Federation Endpoints, OpenID Connect client registration. |
| [**OpenID Federation 1.1**](https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_1.html) | **Final** ✓ (2026-05-06) |  **Implemented** (by virtue of 1.0) | Protocol-independent layer — the 1.0 functionality factored apart with no behavioural changes. |
| [**OpenID Federation for OpenID Connect 1.1**](https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-connect-1_1.html) | **Final** ✓ (2026-05-06) |  **Implemented** (by virtue of 1.0) | Protocol-specific layer — OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect entity types, automatic + explicit client registration. |
| [**OpenID Federation Extended Subordinate Listing 1.0**](https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-extended-listing-1_0.html) | *Draft 02* |  **Implemented** (tracks draft-02) | Paginated subordinate listing with audit timestamps and bulk per-entity claim retrieval for large-scale federations. See [docs/packages/authority.md](docs/packages/authority.md#extended-subordinate-listing). |
| [**OpenID Federation Entity Collection 1.0**](https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-entity-collection-1_0.html) | *Draft 00* |  **Not yet implemented** | Sub-federation entity discovery endpoint with hierarchical filtering, pagination, and UI-oriented metadata for login pickers and admin tools. |
| [**OpenID Federation for Wallet Architectures 1.0**](https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-wallet-1_0.html) | *Draft 05* |  **Not yet implemented** | Trust-establishment profile for digital-wallet ecosystems — Wallet Provider / Wallet Relying Party metadata, policy templates, trust mark guidance. |
| [**Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) with OpenID Federation 1.0**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-acme-openid-federation/) | *IETF Internet-Draft (draft-ietf-acme-openid-federation-00)* |  **Not yet implemented** | New Federation Entity Types for ACME Requestor / Issuer roles, enabling automated X.509 issuance over federation discovery. |


> [!NOTE]
> **OpenID Federation 1.1 + OpenID Federation for OpenID Connect 1.1** are a clean split of 1.0 — no functionality was added or removed, only factored apart. A complete 1.0 implementation is therefore a complete 1.1 implementation by definition. **Extended Subordinate Listing** is implemented end-to-end (server endpoint, federation-api client, CLI `list-extended` command) and tracks draft-02 verbatim — see [docs/packages/authority.md](docs/packages/authority.md#extended-subordinate-listing). **Entity Collection**, **Wallet Architectures**, and **ACME-with-Federation** are tracked but not yet implemented; contributions welcome — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

For real-world integration examples see the [Wiring Guide](docs/guide/wiring-guide.md), the [dev federation server](docs/guide/dev.md), and the [E2E test infrastructure](docs/test/e2e.md).

## Federation Operator Notes

Running a federation involves responsibilities beyond what this library enforces. Operators **MUST** read and address:

- [**§18 — Security Considerations**](https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0.html#section-18): DoS prevention for the resolve, fetch, and registration endpoints; `authority_hints` depth limits; Trust Mark filtering; reverse-proxy end-to-end signing.
- [**§19 — Privacy Considerations**](https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0.html#section-19): Entity Statements are org-level infrastructure — keep personal data minimal; mitigate Trust Mark Status and Fetch endpoint tracking via short-lived tokens and static Trust Chains.
- [**§17 — Implementation Considerations**](https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0.html#section-17): Multi-path topology ambiguity; Trust Mark policy design; resolver and Trust Anchor co-location.

This library provides the protocol mechanisms; policy, rate limiting, key management, HSM integration, and operational hardening are the operator's responsibility.
